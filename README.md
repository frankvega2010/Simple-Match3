## Lastest Release : https://github.com/frankvega2010/Simple-Match3/releases/tag/v0.1.1

It's recommended that you have a 1920x1080 screen size or higher to avoid issues. (Otherwise play the game on the editor)

- Chain selection mechanic gameplay, you can select vertical/horizontal adjacent blocks by holding down the Left Mouse Button.
- You can also revert the chain by going backwards in the chain.
- Release the Left Mouse Button to finish the chain.
- (DEV) You can also press '1' to reset the grid, this only has a purpose on the editor since you can change the grid size mid-game.
- Press ESC to quit the game.
